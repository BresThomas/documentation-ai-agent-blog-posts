## Overview

This project aims to build an AI-powered agent that automatically creates blog posts to enhance SEO and significantly drive traffic to your website. As a practical example, I've been using this AI agent on my portfolio site for the past few weeks. Previously, my daily impressions were minimal (around 15 per day), but now they've increased dramatically to about 180 impressions per day, with a rapidly rising growth curve. While there's still room for improvement, we currently have a functional MVP ready to deliver meaningful results.

This guide covers everything you need to know to set up, use, and customize the project. The application automates blog post creation by integrating AI for title generation, outlining, drafting, SEO optimization, editing, translation, markdown formatting, and Git integration.

## How It Works

As you can see, the agent accepts various parameters initially to suggest a list of titles. You can either generate new titles or select one to proceed. Once a title is selected, you can generate the article content according to different criteria, such as the languages you prefer. Finally, the agent will ask for your validation (you can also review and regenerate content), and upon approval, it will push the content to your repository.
